# Turning Text into Tables

This exercise involves converting a given skeleton text file into an HTML table. The text file contains a list of the top 10 movies of all time, according to the top of this list of [AFI's 100 GREATEST AMERICAN MOVIES OF ALL TIME](http://www.afi.com/100Years/movies.aspx)

## Getting Started
* Fork and clone this repository to your computer
* Begin working in the `skeleton.html` file, which has a skeleton of the text needed for the page.

## Requirements

* The page title should be, **AFI's Top Ten 10 Greatest American Movies of all Time**
* The page should correctly use `table`, `thead`, `tbody`, `tr`, `th` and `td` tags.
* Copy and paste all of your HTML into [The W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) and make sure it validates without errors.

## Bonus
If you finish this exercise early consider doing some optional bonus work. Practice creating hyperlink references in anchor tags by creating links from each movie to the movies IMDB page or Wikipeia page, or both.

Use your own discretion to decide where to place the links. If you only add links to one of the pages consider wrapping the movie name in an anchor tag. If you add links to both IMDB and Wikipedia pages consider adding two more columns to the table.
